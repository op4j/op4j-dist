  About Functions

Functions

  Functions are one of the main components of op4j. They are implementations of the
  <<<org.op4j.functions.IFunction\<T,R\>>>> interface, being <<<T>>> the input type
  and <<<R>>> the result type.
  
  For example: <<<IFunction\<String,Integer\>>>> defines a function which takes
  a <<<String>>> as input and returns an <<<Integer>>>.
  
  Inside expressions, functions are executed by the <<<exec(...)>>> action or by any of its variants: 
  <<<map(...)>>>, <<<execAsArray(...)>>>, etc.
  

* Predefined functions: Function hub classes

  op4j provides more than 200 functions out-of-the-box. They are usually obtained by calling
  static methods in <function hub classes>. For example:
  
+--
Function<String,String> fn = FnString.toUpperCase();
+--

  <<<FnString>>> is one of the predefined <function hub classes> (most of them start with <<<Fn>>>), 
  and the <<<toUpperCase()>>> static method returns a function which takes a <<<String>>> input 
  and returns a <<<String>>> result (<<<IFunction\<String,String\>>>>).


  All predefined functions, as well as functions defined with <function expressions> 
  are <<<org.op4j.functions.Function>>> objects, which are
  an implementation of <<<IFunction>>> adding a special <<<execute(T input)>>> method
  for easily calling them <even outside op4j expressions>.
  
  Let's see some random examples:
  
+--
Function<String,String> fn = FnString.trim();
Function<String,Calendar> fn = FnString.toCalendar("dd/MM/yyyy");
Function<Number,BigDecimal> fn = FnNumber.toBigDecimal(2, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);
Function<Iterable<Double>,Double> fn = FnDouble().avg();
Function<Iterable<Integer>,Integer> fn = FnInteger().max();
Function<String[],String[]> fn = FnArray.ofString().distinct();
+--

  As we can see, some function hub classes like <<<FnArray>>> are a little bit special because they
  require specialization (type parameterization), which is what is done with the <<<ofString()>>> 
  method.
  
  Let's see another example of specialization:
  
+--
Type<User> type = ...;
Function<List<User[]>,List<User>> fn = FnList.ofArrayOf(type).flattenArrays();
+--

* User-defined functions

** Function expressions

  Functions can be created by means of <<<Fn.on>>> expressions:
  
+--
Function<List<String>,List<Calendar>> fnParseStringDates =
    Fn.onListOf(Types.STRING).map(FnString.toCalendar("dd/MM/yyyy")).get();
+--

  As functions created with <function expressions> return <<<org.op4j.functions.Function>>> objects
  they can be easily called <even outside op4j expressions>:

+--
List<Calendar> calendars = fnParseStringDates.execute(stringDates);  
+--


** Custom functions

  Creating a custom function without using a function expression is as simple as implementing
  the one-method <<<IFunction>>> interface:

+--
public class MyFunction implements IFunction<Integer,String> {

    public String execute(Integer input, ExecCtx ctx) throws Exception {
        return "The input number is: " + input;
    }
        
}
+--

  ...which can also be done anonymously:
  
+--
String result = 
    Op.on(value).exec(new IFunction<Integer,String>() {
        public String execute(Integer input, ExecCtx ctx) throws Exception {
            return "The input number is: " + input;
        }
    }).get();
+--
