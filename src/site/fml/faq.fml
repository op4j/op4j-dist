    <faq id="where-does-op4-come-from">
      <question>Where does op4j come from? Is it made or backed by any software company?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          op4j is Open Source Software created by a Spanish Software Engineer
          called <a href="team.html">Daniel Fernández</a> with help from another Spanish
          Software Engineer called <a href="team.html">Soraya Sánchez</a> in their spare time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It is neither made nor backed
          by any software (or any other type of) company, and it is offered to the public
          totally free of charge, both in binary and in source code forms, under the <b>Apache License 2.0</b>.

    <faq id="what-is-relation-op4j">
      <question>What is javaRuntype's relation to the op4j project?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          javaRuntype was conceived at first as a part of the op4j project [<a href="http://www.op4j.org">http://www.op4j.org</a>],
          and by the same person who created op4j itself, but later during op4j's development it was decided that javaRuntype should be a project
          of its own as its range of application by separate was in fact quite broad.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, javaRuntype remains today as a useful and required dependency for op4j, but it can also
          be used without op4j at all for several different purposes.

      <question>What is op4j useful for?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          op4j is mainly useful for developers. We say it is a <b>developer happiness tools</b> because
          its aim is mainly to enable developers to create cleaner and more readable java code, especially
          auxiliary code (data conversions, structure managing, etc).
